## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Drag and drop the `dist/` folder to Netlify
   - Or use Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Push the `dist/` folder to `gh-pages` branch
   - Or use GitHub Actions for automatic deployment

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### Contact Form Setup

The contact form currently uses a placeholder endpoint. To make it functional:

1. **Formspree** (Recommended):

   - Sign up at https://formspree.io
   - Create a new form and get your form ID
   - Update `src/components/sections/EnhancedContact.tsx` line 35:
     ```typescript
     const response = await fetch("https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID", {
     ```

2. **Netlify Forms**:

   - Add `data-netlify="true"` to the form element
   - Deploy to Netlify

3. **Custom Backend**:
   - Replace the fetch URL with your custom API endpoint

### Analytics (Optional)

Add your analytics tracking:

1. **Google Analytics**:

   - Add tracking code to `index.html`

2. **Vercel Analytics**:
   - Install: `npm install @vercel/analytics`
   - Add to your app

## üåç Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:

1. **Create `.env` file** (already in .gitignore):

   ```
   VITE_API_URL=your_api_url
   VITE_FORM_ENDPOINT=your_form_endpoint
   ```

2. **Use in code**:
   ```typescript
   const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
   ```

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Website loads correctly
- [ ] All pages are accessible
- [ ] Contact form works (if configured)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance scores (use Lighthouse)
- [ ] No console errors

## üéâ You're Ready!

Your portfolio website is now production-ready and secure for public deployment!
